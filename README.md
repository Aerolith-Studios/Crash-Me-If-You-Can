# CrashMeIfYouCan
Repo for Crash Me if You Can - Our Adelaide Game Jam game continues!

Well, hey guys! Welcome to the new Aerolith Studios account!

A few really quick things.. 

1. When you guys are fiddling with code and new features, please save it in an appropriate branch.
2. When you're completely done and the feature works perfectly with no bugs, create a Pull Request for everyone to review the changes.
3. Once it's been reviewed and accepted by everyone the new feature will be consolidated into the Develop branch!
4. Once everyone is happy and all features are working well enough for a release, the develop branch will be consolidated into the master!

IMPORTANT: We always want the Master to be perfect with no bugs! Please DON'T EVER SYNC STRAIGHT TO THE MASTER! It needs to be playable at all times!

Thanks guys, look forward to smashing out some games with you all!
